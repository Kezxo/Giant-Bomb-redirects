# Giant Bomb redirects
This is a page that lists URLs that redirect to giantbomb.com or associated
destinations. It's based on a very similar page I did for Waypoint redirects.

The page exists under a number of aliases:

[haunted.domains/suıɐɯop˙pǝʇunɐɥ](http://haunted.domains/suıɐɯop˙pǝʇunɐɥ)  
[haunted.domains/gb](http://haunted.domains/gb)  
[somewhat.haunted.domains](http://somewhat.haunted.domains)  
[slightly.haunted.domains](http://slightly.haunted.domains)  

It could do with a domain of its own, but I already spend too much money on
nonsense domains, so unless someone is kind enough to donate something
fitting, those will have to do.

Please feel free to make your own contributions. I try to keep it up-to-date,
but I'm not too involved in chat or the community at large, so I miss a fair
amount of stuff.

It's pretty straightforward. `index.php` pulls from a few plaintext lists to
build the various sections of the page. `!` at the start of a line marks that
URL as dead (i.e. non-clickable, formatted with a strikethrough).

If you do make an edit, please keep things alphabetical.
